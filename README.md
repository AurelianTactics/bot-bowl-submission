Package dependencies must be specified in setup.py and the bot script must register the bot with a name.

Read more about the rules on https://bot-bowl.com/rules-and-software/.

In case of any other install dependencies, please specify them here. 

You can test your bot repository by installing it using "pip install -e ." in the directory and then run a modified version of https://github.com/njustesen/ffai/blob/master/examples/competition_example.py where you run a competition using your bot name in the make_bot call. Remember to import you package, e.g. "import simplebot".
